Wine runner for DCS.

## TrackIR

This runner handles trackIR with linuxtrack if installed in your wineprefix.
To install trackIR soft in wineprefix, go in the path you installed linuxtrack (tested on linuxtrack 0.99.18),
then enter path `share/linuxtrack`, there should be a file named `linuxtrack-wine.exe`.

Source dcs.sh (run `source dcs.sh`) to your terminal to have env DCS env, then run `wine linuxtrack-wine.exe`.
After completion, dcs will automatically start you TrackIR.
